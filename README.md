# This Week (3/14):
[Bubble Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/)

## algorithmClub
A place to save the results of the algorithm club for the 2019Q1 Apprentice Cohort

To best join in the weekly code reviews, follow the steps below...

### 1 Clone the whole repo

### 2 Create your own branch for each algorithm
Follow the same convention as with the kata repo, eg "jmBubbleSort"

### 3 Follow This Directory Structure:
-  firstname-lastname (should only need to create the first time)
    - algorithmName
    
Eg:
- john-macgregor
  - bubbleSort

This should give us a root repo directory, with a 2nd layer of personal directories, and within each of those everyone's implementation of each algorithm
