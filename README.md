# This Week (3/14):
[Bubble Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/)

## algorithmClub
A place to save the results of the algorithm club for the 2019Q1 Apprentice Cohort

To best join in the weekly code reviews, follow the steps below...

### 1 Clone the whole repo

### 2 Create your own branch for each algorithm
Follow the same convention as with the kata repo, eg "jmBubbleSort"

### 3 Follow This Directory Structure:
-  firstname-lastname (should only need to create the first time)
    - algorithmName
    
Eg:
- john-macgregor
  - bubbleSort

### 4 Write your code / make commits against your weekly branch

### 5 When your implementation is finished, create a pull request against master

### 6 We'll review all the code reviews as a group and merge them in as we go during the weekly meetup

This should give us a root repo directory, with a 2nd layer of personal directories, and within each personal directory will be all their algorithm implementations
